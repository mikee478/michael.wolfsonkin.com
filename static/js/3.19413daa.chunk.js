What makes this simulation unique is its ability to achieve realistic water movement without the use of trigonometric functions or differential equations.","At its core, the simulation employs a straightforward yet effective approach to update the water's height and simulate its behavior. The 2D grid serves as a canvas where the height of the water is depicted at each discrete location. The simulation dynamically evolves by iterating over each grid cell, recalculating the water's height based on neighboring cells and estimated velocity.","To update the water's height at a particular grid cell, the simulation computes the average height of its neighboring cells. This collective average serves as a foundation for the height update. Additionally, the simulation introduces the concept of estimated velocity, which is determined by subtracting the current height from the previous height. By incorporating this velocity component, the simulation emulates the movement and flow of water.","The utilization of the average height of neighboring cells, coupled with the estimated velocity, results in a visually striking representation of raindrop behavior. As raindrops interact with the grid, their impact creates ripples that propagate and merge with adjacent ripples, producing an intricate and captivating water simulation.","Furthermore, this project offers the flexibility to explore alternative methods beyond averaging the heights of neighboring cells, enabling the generation of unique visual effects. By incorporating different averaging techniques, the simulation can create a wave-like behavior in the water. These waves can propagate through the grid, interacting with the raindrops and producing mesmerizing patterns. Additionally, by experimenting with alternative approaches, the simulation can also achieve abstract artistic effects, transforming the representation of water into a visually captivating and imaginative display."],github_link:"https://github.com/mikee478/raindrop-simulation"},{title:"Polygon Utilities",category:"",cover_image:h,url_id:"polygon-utilities",publish_date:"November 2022",page_images:[],page_videos:[{poster:g,video:b}],technologies:["Python","PyGame"],project_details:["A simple tool to build simple polygons!","Includes counter clockwise testing, self-intersection testing, point in polygon testing (winding number, ray casting), ear clipping triangulation, sample points within a polygon (rejection sampling, triangulation sampling), convex hull algorithms (gift wrapping, Graham's scan), and visibility polygon"],github_link:"https://github.com/mikee478/polygon-utilities"},{title:"Interactive Quadtree",category:"",cover_image:x,url_id:"interactive-quadtree",publish_date:"November 2022",page_images:[],page_videos:[{poster:w,video:k}],technologies:["Python","PyGame","NumPy"],project_details:["A point quadtree is a data structure used to store and efficiently search for points in a two-dimensional space.
